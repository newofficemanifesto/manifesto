# New Office Manifesto.

## Finding a **New Consensus** for Post-Covid Work.

New Office Manifesto was set up to drive debate and discussion around how we all return to work after the COVID-19 crisis. Collating a new **Manifesto** of guiding principles for forward-thinking businesses and employees to follow. We want to learn from this once in a generation event, build on the investments businesses and employees have already made, and find a sustainable future that works for all - **Home, Office, Hybrid.**

We're modelling this on the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), which revolutionised the way modern software is developed.

## Alpha Principles

> ## 1. [**Personal** Connections over **Physical** Connections](https://twitter.com/manifesto_new/status/1377292359797460992?s=20)
> Teams should be built around strong personal connections, not just people being physically close to each other.
> Strong team dynamics should come from a shared goal, not a shared workspace.

Help us shape and expand the principles by getting in touch, becoming a partner, or giving feedback. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manifesto_new)
