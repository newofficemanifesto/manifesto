# New Office Manifesto.

## Finding a **New Consensus** for Post-Covid Work.

New Office Manifesto was set up to drive debate and discussion around how we all return to work after the COVID-19 crisis. Collating a new **Manifesto** of guiding principles for forward-thinking businesses and employees to follow. We want to learn from this once in a generation event, build on the investments businesses and employees have already made, and find a sustainable future that works from all - Home, Office, Hybrid.
